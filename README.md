## Intro
I'm reconstructing "alexzeit/Slither.io-bot-1" piece by piece and reviewing my math & trigonometry as I go.

This is a bot with a long and interesting history. Go check out the these repos, these 20+ contributors are the real wizards. 
- https://github.com/ErmiyaEskandary/Slither.io-bot
- https://github.com/j-c-m/Slither.io-bot
- https://github.com/alexzeit/Slither.io-bot-1

This is mostly me tinkering with this bot, but I'll be attemping to:
- Give the code an improved structure.
- Turn features on/off, off/low/med/high.
- Give the player control over what happens.
